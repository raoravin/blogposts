While putting some finishing touches on my blog, I realized I had not spent much time thinking about **metadata**. Sure, I had the basic _title_,  _description_ and _keywords_ fields, but maybe I needed more. After reviewing [standard metadata names](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta/name), I decided to add the _applicationName_, _authors_, _generator_, _referrer_, _creator_ and _publisher_ fields as well. 

My root **layout** file for the blog contains _static_ metadata like this:

```ts
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: {
    template: '%s | Dave Gray',
    default: "Dave Gray Teaches Code",
  },
  description: "Hello, I'm Dave. ðŸ‘‹ I teach coding and web development skills.",
  applicationName: "Dave Gray's Blog",
  authors: [{ name: "Dave Gray" }],
  generator: 'Next.js',
  keywords: ['dave gray', 'code', 'web development', 'javascript', 'react', 'node.js', 'next.js', 'web dev', 'html', 'css', 'python'],
  referrer: 'origin-when-cross-origin',
  creator: 'Dave Gray',
  publisher: 'Dave Gray',
}
```

And my _dynamic_ post pages generate specific metadata from the [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files they receive like this:

```ts 
export async function generateMetadata({ params: { postId } }: Props) {

    const post = await getPostByName(`${postId}.mdx`)

    if (!post) {
        return {
            title: 'Post Not Found'
        }
    }

    const { meta } = post

    return {
        title: meta.title,
        description: meta.description,
        keywords: [...meta.tags],
    }
}
```
_At this point, I began to wonder if I needed to add the other metadata fields to my dynamically generated post pages..._

I referenced the Next.js docs and was glad to see Next.js supports [Metadata Ordering](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata#ordering) and [Metadata Merging](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata#merging). 

Next.js follows an _evaluation order_ for metadata beginning with the root layout, followed by nested layouts and finally, evaluating any specific page file. 

Following the evaluation order, exported Metadata objects are then shallowly merged together. This means the static Metadata fields I provided in my root layout do not need to be duplicated in my blog post page files. The Metadata is merged and still represented in each generated page. Any field I provide in the page file will overwrite the same field from the parent layout file or files, too. 

_Nice!_

With the basic Metadata conquered, I then realized I need to dive-in and learn about [more Metadata](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata) I can provide including (but not limited to):

- openGraph
- icons
- alternates

As I learn more about these other Metadata types and add them to my blog site, I'll be sure to share what I learn about them here, too.
